    <p>The Grumley Group: Mental Health Services provides consulting for government divisions including school districts, correction, social services and mental health. Currently, select multiyear contracts with Circle North Training in northern Canada and Rockford Public Schools in the Midwest focus on workshops and consulting with correctional officers/case workers, youth care workers, child protection staff, victim services staff, and educators at all levels from superintendents to paraprofessionals.</p>
    <p>Dr. Grumley works in collaboration with Lynn Taylor from Yellowknife to deliver the Healing and Learning Together (HALT) consulting and workshop in the western Arctic. Again, with Ms. Taylor we deliver the Nunavut Healing and Learning Together (NUHALT) in the eastern Arctic. These contracts and other multiyear school contracts in northern Canada have been delivered since 1996 with Circle North Training. </p>
    <p>Dr. Grumley works as a consultant for the Rockford Public Schools providing training in "A Connected School", based upon a book he co-authored of the same title in 2003. Subsequently, he and Ms. Taylor wrote "A Connected Classroom" providing lessons for the first weeks of the school year, and they lead workshops of the same title. In Rockford, Dr. Grumley works with Ms. Vicki Jacobson, Assistant Superintendent for Elementary Schools to lead the elementary school in utilizing A Connected School approach to improve academic and behavioral performance. This current contract has been in operation for the past two years with significant results in achieving the desired outcomes.</p>
